MPU6050 Calibration Sketch

Your MPU6050 should be placed in horizontal position, with package letters facing up. 
Don't touch it until you see a finish message.

FINISHED!

Sensor readings with offsets:	-8	-4	16380	0	0	0
Your offsets:	-343	-7	1809	62	-7	15

Data is printed as: acelX acelY acelZ giroX giroY giroZ
Check that your sensor readings are close to 0 0 16384 0 0 0
If calibration was succesful write down your offsets so you can set them in your projects using something similar to mpu.setXAccelOffset(youroffset)
